 Like spi_flash_read, spi_flash_write has a requirement for flash address to be
 aligned. However it also requires RAM address to be aligned as it reads data
 in 32-bit words. Flash address (mis-)alignment is handled much the same way
 as for reads, but for RAM alignment we have to copy data into a temporary
 buffer. The size of this buffer is a tradeoff between number of writes required
 and amount of stack required. This is chosen to be 512 bytes here, but might
 be adjusted in the future if there are good reasons to do so.
